FIRST PROJECT - BIKESTORES 

Bikestores Comprehensive retail sales dashboard using Tableau

I’m creating a comprehensive sales dashboard for the executive team at Bikestores. First by pulling out the relevant data from the company’s database using SQL [BikestoresSQLCode](https://github.com/Temitope-Fabiyi/SQL_Projects/blob/main/Bikestores/Bikestores%20SQL%20Code) and then designing a well structured dynamic dashboard using tableau. I would be following the five steps involved in all data analytics projects for this portfolio. But first let me give an overview of what the end will look like. The first thing I will do is tap into the Company’s relational database by writing an sql script to generate a detailed dataset that provides me with all the data & information I need to put together a comprehensive & dynamic sales dashboard for the executive team [BikestoresSQLCode](https://github.com/Temitope-Fabiyi/SQL_Projects/blob/main/Bikestores/Bikestores%20SQL%20Code)
Then import the sql generated dataset into excel  ![BikestoresTable](https://github.com/Temitope-Fabiyi/SQL_Projects/blob/main/Bikestores/BikestoresTable.png), And then I’m going to connect the excel data sheet that contains the sql generated dataset to tableau and use the information & data to generate this visually pleasing & dynamic dashboard for Management [BikestoresDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bikestore_17237836157350/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


For the first, I need to know what exactly the Management want, they want to know the condition of the sales activities within the company and gain insight into the various trends happening in the sales volume over the 2016 - 2018 period. They also want to know the revenues per region, per store, per product category & per brand, a list of the top customers, sales rep could also prove insightful.

Having determined what their needs & goals are, I figured out how to provide that information in the most organized & digestible way.

So the best course of action is to provide a comprehensive dashboard with tableau. One that clearly has all the metrics they require and can easily access.[BikestoresDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bikestore_17237836157350/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
